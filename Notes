In assocications, you must make aliases, to be called like this:
this.belongsTo(Surah,      {foreignKey:'surahId', **as:'surah'**})
include:{
    model: Ayah.sequelize.models.Surah,
   **as:'surah'**
}
⚠️If not: Surah is associated to Ayah using an alias. You must use the 'as' keyword to specify the alias within your include statement.


In migration, don't use models names, use only table names because it's at db level, espically in
**refernces:{ model: *'TABLENAME'*}**

**Composite Keys**: Tracker model must have a unique _combination_ of userId and date; in the 2nd object of model.init => indexes:[ { type:unique, fields:['userId','date'] } ]👌✨

**Associations** 
hasOne - "One other has a foreign key pointing to me" => 1-M
hasMany - "Others have foreign keys pointing to me" => 1-M
belongsTo - "I have the foreign key pointing to another" => M-1
belongsToMany - "Many-to-many through a junction table" => M-M
