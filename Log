1-Tafseer Model: CRUDs & relation with Ayah Model
2-SEARCHSS: Search By [Surah, Juz, Ayah]

3-Voice Recitation?

**💫 Done By 22/1/2026 [CompletePageAssign]💫** 
11/16 => Ayah Bulk Insert Done💫 Bulk Page Assign Done💫
Before adding the rest of the surahs, pageNumber problem must be resolved
[BulkPageAssign] => API that takes the 1st and last ayah of that page, and assignes all the ayat 'pageNumber'  in between (inclusive) to that page
Will be done to the whole 604 pages | But that's the fastest method, instead of doing them manually one-by-one
If done as inteded, a page assign won't take >10 sec.
Same must be done to Juz assignment


11/21 => Tafseer CRUDs & Bulk Insert Done 💫
